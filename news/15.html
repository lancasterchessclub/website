<p>11th June 2022</p>
<p>As previously, there has been a devoid of updates here, but the club
has had an action-packed spring full of events, and continues to move
from strength to strength.</p>
<p>It is, however, with a heavy heart that we said goodbye to Barry
Hymer as a full time member and Secretary of the club, as he is leaving
the area. This was news which came as a shock to many of us and is no
doubt a massive loss.</p>
<p>Iâ€™m not the correct person to assess the full impact Barry has had on
the club since he joined, having only become a member here in 2019,
where he welcomed me himself. For my part, I can say that in my time
here Barry has been a huge force for good within the club. He was always
a leader through management of administrative matters in his capacity of
secretary (a role that I believe he never coveted, but rather absorbed
for the good of us all!), tournament matters as captain of the Lancaster
A team, as well as being the de facto face of the club when talking to
and greeting potential new members. In the past year along with David he
played an essential role in the move to our new premises of the Bridge
club, which has been instrumental in the development of the club and
leaves us in good stead.</p>
<p>We were delighted to award him Honorary Lifetime Membership and hope
that he can drop in now and then. Thank you Barry!</p>
