1944-2020</h1>
<p>14th April 2020</p>
<p>It is with great sadness that we report the unexpected death of Dick
Collins on Tuesday 7th April 2020, reportedly of a heart attack. Dick
had an association with our club going back many decades, and though he
had played for Morecambe in team competitions in recent years, he also
retained his membership of LCC and was a familiar sight to all of our
members. Dick was a mainstay of chess locally and more widely in the NW
through his play for Lancashire in county chess, and Manchester
Manticores in the 4NCL league. I am reliably informed that in the ’70s
and ’80s Dick was one of the strongest players in the NW, playing off a
peak grading in excess of 200, and though this had dropped a good deal
in recent years, he remained a formidable and competitive opponent to
all but the very strongest. No doubt there will be fuller and more
detailed tributes to Dick appearing in many places over the weeks to
come, but we wish to pay our own tribute here to a fine player, a valued
and popular member of LCC, and a real gentleman.</p>
<p>The game below has no great distinction, other than it was probably
Dick’s last competitive game, and it reveals his obstinacy when
defending a cramped position. It was played in the final of this year’s
league Level competition - a tournament which Dick had won on countless
occasions. At the start of the game Dick gestured cheerily to Phil
Seery, whom he’d played in the final of the same competition back in the
’70s. None of us knew this was to be Dick’s final contribution. It
concluded, perhaps fittingly, with a draw - Dick’s preferred result in
recent years. We had arranged to play the rematch the following week,
but by then social distancing measures had taken effect, and that
rematch never took place. RIP Dick.</p>
