Quick-Play Tournament - September 2021</h1>
<p>12th September 2021</p>
<p>On the 5th of September, a number of local chess players gathered at
the Lancaster Brewery for a quick play tournament organized by Richard
Walsh.</p>
<p>With a turnout of 12 players from the local area (unfortunately,
there were some last minute withdrawals), the tournament was played with
a Swiss system over 5 rounds. The winners were jointly Barry Hymer &amp;
David Phillips both with 4 1/2, while a lower graded prize was awarded
to Riddhiman Ghosh and Iain Walmsley both scoring 3.</p>
<p>For many it proved to be a long awaited return to over the board
chess which had been dearly missed. Overall, it really was a fantastic
day with everyone enjoying the chess as well as the company.</p>
<p>Thanks go to the Lancaster Brewery for hosting us, it proved to be an
inspired venue with a nice outdoor space (and tasty beer!). Thanks also
have to go to Richard for taking the initiative and providing us all
with a day to remember. Finally, thanks go to Lawrence for running the
tournament.</p>
<p>Below are a number of photos taken on the day.</p>
