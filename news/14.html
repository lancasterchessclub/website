<p>30th January 2022</p>
<p>On the 25th of January, replacing our usual clubnight, Lawrence ran a
10-minute 5 round quick play tournament that was enjoyed by all. This
was belated celebration of our move to the premises of the Lancaster
Bridge Club, which, while early days, has been a real success. I think
everyone had a fantastic evening, and I personally saw some brilliant
(and at times, highly questionable) chess. As usual, a huge thanks must
go to Lawrence for running the tounament as well as Barry for
facilitating.</p>
<p>The joint winners were James &amp; Danny, who fought out an
incredibly tense draw to each end the event on 4 1/2 out of 5.
Incredibly, and perhaps in part due to the members not playing a huge
amount of blitz, this was the only draw of the entire event. Grading
prizes went to some of the younger entrants, Jack Eccles, Ned Griffin,
Eric Thompson &amp; Jack Wilkinson.</p>
<p>We look forward now to the remainder of the season, where we are keen
for members to complete their fixtures for the Club Championship.</p>

Nothing better than seeing a room full of people focused on chess -
downstairs was highly utilised as well.

A tense final match between James and Danny, the result? A draw.
