			<p><strong>Third Lancaster Standard Play Congress - 15-17 August
2025</strong></p>
<p><img width="100%"  src="/congress-20250815/1.1jpeg" /></p>
<p>On the weekend commencing 15th of august Lancaster held their Third
Annual Lancaster standard play chess congress in the Storey Building
Lancaster. The event was organised by Lancaster Chess Club secretary
Richard Walsh and got 85 entrants across 4 competitive sections, the
Open, Major, Intermediate and Minor collaborating into a weekend of fun
and high level chess with players from all demographics and age
attending, even getting a visitor from France to play in the
intermediate section. Â£2750 worth of prizes was won including multiple
diversity prizes for the best score from under 16, over 65 and female
player; this tournament was both ECF and FIDE rated meaning new players
could gain a FIDE id and rating allowing them to play international
tournaments. A great event carried out by fabulous hosts and organisers
attracting a range of youngsters and wealthy experience including an
international master in the open section who became to outright winner
with 5/5. A great experience for local players as it boasted a good
showing from Lancaster University students who performed really well in
the inter and minor sections respectively. We plan to host a one-day
rapid tournament on the 24th of January which is an entirely different
experience to a standard play tournament and is highly recommended for
any player searching for improvement. And of course, our doors are open
every Tuesday night at Lancaster chess club and allow one and all to
attend from beginners to pros all are welcome, more information can be
found on Lancaster Chess Clubs online website and social media pages</p>
