On the weekend commencing 15th of august Lancaster held their Third Annual Lancaster standard play chess congress in the Storey Building Lancaster. The event was organised by Lancaster Chess Club secretary Richard Walsh and got 85 entrants across 4 competitive sections, the Open, Major, Intermediate and Minor collaborating into a weekend of fun and high level chess with players from all demographics and age attending, even getting a visitor from France to play in the intermediate section. Â£2750 worth of prizes was won including multiple diversity prizes for the best score from under 16, over 65 and female player; this tournament was both ECF and FIDE rated meaning new players could gain a FIDE id and rating allowing them to play international tournaments. A great event carried out by fabulous hosts and organisers attracting a range of youngsters and wealthy experience including an international master in the open section who became to outright winner with 5/5. A great experience for local players as it boasted a good showing from Lancaster University students who performed really well in the inter and minor sections respectively. We plan to host a one-day rapid tournament on the 24th of January which is an entirely different experience to a standard play tournament and is highly recommended for any player searching for improvement. And of course, our doors are open every Tuesday night at Lancaster chess club and allow one and all to attend from beginners to pros all are welcome, more information can be found on Lancaster Chess Clubs online website and social media pages
