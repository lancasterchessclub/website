## A Friendly Chess Club in the Heart of Lancaster

**Update: - [**15 – 17 August 2025** Third Lancaster Standard Play Congress  - £2,750 in Prizes](/congress/20250815.html)**

Based in the heart of Lancaster, UK, our historic chess club, which dates back to 1895, welcomes players of all ages and abilities to come and enjoy a game of chess. Be it for short, long, casual or competitive games there's something for everyone.

We meet weekly over the course of the year. Highlights range from the club chess championship (90 minutes), to the rapid play championship, as well as  blitz chess tournaments. We take part in the local league and the Blackpool and Fylde league. For players who prefer to play casually, club nights always offer the opportunity to have a game. We provide tutoring for juniors on club night and host drop in chess at Lancaster library every Saturday morning. We run two National chess congresses each year.

If this sounds good, see the information for club nights below - please do get in touch via e-mail and we look forward to welcoming you soon!
