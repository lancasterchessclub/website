<p>Fancy a game of online chess? Then why not sign up to Lancaster’s
online chess club. As you would expect it is also called “Lancaster
Chess Club”. You can log on to join at this link. <a
href="https://www.chess.com/club/lancaster-chess-club">https://www.chess.com/club/lancaster-chess-club</a>
. We will be hosting online events, daily games, and offering a forum to
discuss various topics. You will have to send an invite to join the
club, just put your name and a sentence about yourself for example “Joe
Bloggs, Live in Garstang and love chess!” and one of the administrators
will accept you onto the club. All are welcome to join, beginners
through to experts, club affiliation is not needed but we encourage
those who do join our site to also come to the club or the library
sessions if you can.</p>

<p>James is a local schoolteacher and one of our club’s strongest
players. He runs our chess in schools programme. Every Tuesday he hosts
a half hour coaching and training session for our under 18 members. He
is also reaching out to encourage chess playing in local secondary
schools including setting up school chess clubs and arranging
competitions between youngsters.</p>

<p>Lancaster Chess Club also has strong links with the National Charity
Chess in Schools and Communities who provide curriculum and tutors for
primary schools. You can find more about the charity on their website <a
href="https://www.chessinschools.co.uk">www.chessinschools.co.uk</a>.
Tutoring is available through Callum Woods who is a CSC qualified chess
tutor. Primary schools who are interested in chess tutoring for their
pupils should contact CSC via their website who will ask for information
about your requirements and then put you in touch with our Secretary,
who is also Regional Organiser for CSC across Lancashire.</p>
<h3 id="chess-in-our-community">Chess in our community</h3>
<p><img width="100%" src="/anto_library.jpg" /></p>
<p>Anto is a Professor at Lancaster University Management School and
runs our chess in communities programme. He hosts this every Saturday at
Lancaster Library from 10am until noon. The library has plenty of sets
and boards. So no need to bring your own. This is a free drop in service
although we also have some regulars who turn up most Saturdays. All ages
are welcome. The focus is on friendly games and Anto also provides
training for those who want it. He is one of our club’s strongest
players and sometimes gives simultaneous displays playing many opponents
at the same time.</p>
