<p>A player qualifying for two prizes receives only the higher of the
two prizes. Prize money is subject to change depending on number of
entrants. In the event of a tie for grading prize, the prize is awarded
to the lowest graded player. Swiss manager dictates the pairings in all
rounds and they are not changed to suit individual preferences.
Cancellations – in the event that a player is unable to attend there
will be no refund if the withdrawal is made after 1 December 2024, but
please let the organiser know so pairings can be rearranged. A half
point bye may only be taken in round 1. If you wish to take this up
please let the congress organiser know when you enter.</p>
<p><strong>How to find the venue</strong></p>
<p>The venue (The Centre) is just behind the main church building in the
centre of Lancaster. Teas and coffees on a self-service basis will be
available. There are lots of places to buy food and drink within a very
short walking distance.</p>
<p><strong>Getting there by rail or bus</strong></p>
<p>The venue is 10-15 minutes walk from the railway station. Leave the
station and walk up to the main road. Turn left and walk towards the
city centre. Cross over at the T junction. Turn right. Carry on until
you reach Common Garden St where the buses stop. Turn left down the
street and turn right at Penny Street. Walk up the hill until you reach
St Thomas church and turn left down Marton Street – the Centre is on the
right hand side.</p>
<p>There are plenty of buses to Lancaster. Many stop at Common Garden
Street. All other buses stop at the main bus station which is 10 minutes
walk to the venue.</p>
<p><strong>Getting there by car and parking</strong></p>
<p><strong>From the North</strong></p>
<p>Leave M6 at J34. Turn onto the A683 and travel towards Lancaster for
1.5 miles joining the one-way system at the traffic lights. Choose the
right hand lane and continue for approximately half a mile. Keep going
past Dalton Square (statue of Queen Victoria) signed Clitheroe. Go
straight up to the traffic lights bearing right and turn right. Bear
right again taking the right fork down Penny Street. Turn right at
Marton Street just after St Thomas Church and the venue and car park are
on your right hand side</p>
<p><strong>From the South</strong></p>
<p>Leave the M6 at J33. Travel towards Lancaster on the A6 North for
approximately 4 miles. When you go round the roundabout heading close to
the city be in the right hand lane as you pass Lancaster hospital. At
the traffic lights bear right and take the right fork down Penny Street.
Turn right at Marton Street just after St Thomas Church and the venue
and car park are on your right hand side</p>
<p><strong>Parking</strong></p>
<p>There is a dedicated free parking area off Marton Street behind the
Centre accessed by a slip road. There are around 20 spaces there. The
code to access the car park will be 3173 on the day. First come first
served. Apart from that there are a number of parking areas in the
centre of Lancaster but all of them charge. If you travel south of the
city centre you will find free on street parking down side streets but
build in plenty of time to find a space and make your way to the
venue.</p>
