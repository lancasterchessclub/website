Grade</p>
<p>Players without a current grade should use any grading previously
held from the on-line ECF database and provide reference number from the
site. This will be accepted as their grading subject to approval by the
organisers.</p>
<p>Ungraded players are not eligible for a grading prize.</p>
<p>A player qualifying for two prizes receives only the higher of the
two prizes. In the event of a tie for a grading prize, the prize is
awarded to the lowest graded player</p>
<p>Swiss manager dictates the pairings in all rounds and they are not
changed to suit individual preferences.</p>
<h3 id="arbitration">Arbitration</h3>
<p>In the event of a dispute we would expect players to sort it out
between themselves. However is this is not possible the game will paused
until two officials are available from two clubs. They will then act in
arbiter role and their decision will be final. In entering players are
deemed to agree with this.</p>
