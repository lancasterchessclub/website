<p><strong>Third Lancaster Standard Play Congress 15 – 17 August 2025 -
£2,600 in Prizes</strong></p>
<p>Contact: Richard Walsh, Congress Director Email – <a
href="mailto:richardsami@hotmail.co.uk"><u>richardsami@hotmail.co.uk</u></a></p>
<p>Welcome to our 5 round ECF rated standard play event. Last year we
experimented by making the Open and Major sections also FIDE rated. This
proved extremely popular. <strong>This year the entire congress will be
FIDE and ECF rated. As last year the Open and Major section games will
be uploaded onto public databases.</strong></p>
<p>We are pleased to say that we are back where we started - at The
Storey which is in the heart of the city. For international visitors why
not make a nice holiday out of it. Lancaster is a historic city and also
close to the English Lake District. The venue is opposite the Castle.
Follow this link to Lancaster attractions and we hope to offer discounts
during the congress. <a

. We are very grateful to Lancaster BID for sponsoring our congress.</p>
<p><strong>As the event is FIDE rated all entrants must have a FIDE ID
and as such must be ECF gold or above members or have a FIDE ID from
outside England and an up to date registration with their own national
chess association/federation. FIDE ID comes free with ECF gold
membership. If you are a gold member and do not have a FIDE ID then we
will need your date of birth to get you one. Junior gold ECF membership
is free for the first year.</strong></p>
<p>The advantages of having a FIDE ID and rating are that you can play
in any FIDE rated event in the world – handy for holidays!</p>
<p><strong>Our capacity is 120 entrants. Once it’s full it’s
full.</strong> On-line entry only.</p>
<p>We hope there will be a chess stall in the analysis room selling
books etc.</p>
<p>Prize fund £2600 subject to entries plus additional prizes subject to
sponsorship. This is a not for profit event. Donations are welcome.</p>
<p>Food and drink will be on sale in the licenced café area downstairs

Residents at the hotel will be able to use the gym there at no extra

discount). Alternatively, you can call the hotel directly and let the
reception team know that they are attending the event and would like the
15% discount applied. They have also extended the offer to stretch from
start of that week leading to 15<sup>th</sup> and leading on 7 days
after the 17<sup>th</sup> in case some entrants wish to take advantage
to visit different parts of Lancaster and see what the whole area has in
store.</p></li>

<p><strong>Small print</strong></p>
<p><strong>Parental responsibility</strong></p>
<p>Parents are responsible for their children during the congress, the
congress organisers and arbiters are not to act as “in loco parents” and
are not able to take responsibility for any child’s actions. Or for the
actions of anyone that may affect your child. Parents may not speak to
their children during their child’s game, or vice versa, without
approaching the arbiters first.</p>
<p><strong>Other conditions</strong></p>
<p>Eligibility for grade-restricted sections is determined by the
published July ECF or FIDE grading list. This means that which section
you enter may be changed by the organisers if your grade changes between
the date of entry and the release of the July ratings. Players’ ECF or
FIDE ratings from the August 2024 list will be used for determining
tournament pairings, and grading prizes.</p>
<p>All sections are ECF and FIDE graded. The following priority is used
for section allocation and seeding in the Standard Play event.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>ECF Standard Play Grade</p></li>
<li><p>FIDE Standard Play Rating</p></li>
<li><p>ECF Rapid Play Grade</p></li>
<li><p>FIDE Rapid Play Grade</p></li>
<li><p>ECF on-line Standard Play Grade</p></li>
<li><p>FIDE on-line Standard Play Grade</p></li>
<li><p>ECF on-line Rapid Play Grade</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Players without a current grade should use any grading previously
held from the on-line ECF or FIDE database and provide the link from the
site. This may be accepted as their grading subject to approval by the
Chief Arbiter. Provisional grades may be used subject to decision by the
Chief Arbiter.</p>
<p>Ungraded players are not eligible for a grading prize.</p>
<p>Ungraded players can only win up to £50 for the major, intermediate
or minor events. Any unallocated prize money in either event will be
allocated to the runner up assuming they are graded.</p>
<p>A player qualifying for two prizes receives only the higher of the
two prizes. We may make an exception for some additional prizes that are
subject to sponsorship. If this happens we will update the information
on this website.. Prize money is subject to change depending on number
of entrants.</p>
<p>In the event of a tie for grading prize, the prize is awarded to the
lowest graded player.</p>
<p>Swiss manager dictates the pairings in all rounds and they are not
changed to suit individual preferences.</p>
<p>Cancellations – in the event that a player is unable to attend there
will be no refund for cancellations after 30 June but please let the
organiser know so pairings can be rearranged. No refunds for non UK
entrants.</p>
<p>Byes – entrants may take one half point bye in rounds 1-4. The bye
may not be taken in the last round.</p>
<p>The Open and Major sections will use duplicate score sheets. Both
players must give the top copies to the organisers and sign each of them
to confirm the result. The top copies remain the property of the
congress.</p>
<p>Cars parked anywhere are done so entirely at the owners own risk.</p>
<p><strong>BY ENTERING, PLAYERS AGREE THAT IN THE EVENT OF ANY DISPUTE,
THE ARBITER’S DECISION IS FINAL.</strong></p>
<p><strong>How to find the venue</strong></p>
<p><strong>By road:</strong></p>
<p>Find a parking space in the city centre and walk to the venue.
Alternatively park at your accommodation and either walk or (for the
student accommodation) the 100 bus to Common Garden Street and walk from
there to the venue is an alternative option.</p>
<p><strong>By rail:</strong></p>
<p>Lancaster is on the main west coast rail line from London to Glasgow
and has direct links to Manchester Airport. The Storey is 5 minutes walk
away.</p>
