<p>Entries received after 2 August, if accepted, will require £5 late
entry fee. Eligibility for grade-restricted sections is determined by
the published ECF July grading list, or depending on date of entry.
Application of this rule has allowed several players to move to a lower
section. Grading prizes and pairings will be decided using the ECF July
grading list.</p>
<p>All sections are ECF graded. The following priority is used for
section allocation and seeding in the Standard Play event.</p>
<ul>
<li>ECF Standard Play Grade</li>
<li>FIDE Standard Play Rating</li>
<li>ECF Rapid Play Grade</li>
<li>FIDE Rapid Play Grade</li>

held from the on-line ECF database and provide reference number from the
site – see entry section for more information. This will be accepted as
their grading subject to approval by the organisers.</p>
<p>Ungraded players are not eligible for a grading prize.</p>
<p>Ungraded players can only win up to £50 for the major, intermediate
or minor events. Any unallocated prize money in either event will be
allocated to the runner up assuming they are graded.</p>
<p>A player qualifying for two prizes receives only the higher of the
two prizes. Prize money is subject to change depending on number of
entrants.</p>
<p>In the event of a tie for grading prize, the prize is awarded to the
lowest graded player.</p>
<p>Swiss manager dictates the pairings in all rounds and they are not
changed to suit individual preferences.</p>
<p>Cancellations – in the event that a player is unable to attend there
will be no refund but please let the organiser know so pairings can be
rearranged.</p>
