membership rates will take effect from 1 July. All existing silver
members will be treated as in the new merged category and all those who
renew or join after 1 July will also be in the new merged category. This
means that silver members can enter the FIDE rated sections at no
additional cost. We will refund those who paid the extra £12 before this
change was announced.</p>
<p><strong>Entry costs:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>ECF Silver, Gold or Platinum members £40</p></li>
<li><p>FIDE registered players not affiliated to ENG entering Open or
Major - £42</p></li>

<p>Eligibility for grade-restricted sections is determined by the
published ECF August grading list. This means that which section you
enter may be changed by the organisers if your grade changes between the
date of entry and the release of the August ratings. Players’ ECF
ratings from the August 2024 list will be used for determining
allocation to sections, tournament pairings, and best performance
prizes.</p>
<p>All sections are ECF graded. The Open and Major are FIDE rated. The
following priority is used for section allocation and seeding in the
Standard Play event.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>ECF Standard Play Grade</p></li>
<li><p>FIDE Standard Play Rating</p></li>
<li><p>ECF Rapid Play Grade</p></li>
<li><p>FIDE Rapid Play Grade</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The priority to be used for the seeding in the Blitz and for grading
prizes will be:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>ECF Blitz Grade</p></li>
<li><p>FIDE Blitz Grade</p></li>
<li><p>ECF Rapid Play Grade</p></li>
<li><p>FIDE Rapid Play Grade</p></li>
<li><p>ECF Standard Play Grade</p></li>
<li><p>FIDE Standard Play Grade</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Players without a current grade should use any grading previously
held from the on-line ECF database and provide the link from the site.
This will be accepted as their grading subject to approval by the
organisers.</p>
<p>Ungraded players are not eligible for a grading prize.</p>
<p>Ungraded players can only win up to £50 for the major, intermediate
or minor events. Any unallocated prize money in either event will be
allocated to the runner up assuming they are graded.</p>
<p>A player qualifying for two prizes receives only the higher of the
two prizes. The exception is the special junior prize which is not
included in this rule. Prize money is subject to change depending on
number of entrants.</p>
<p>In the event of a tie for grading prize, the prize is awarded to the
lowest graded player.</p>
<p>Swiss manager dictates the pairings in all rounds and they are not
changed to suit individual preferences.</p>
<p>Cancellations – in the event that a player is unable to attend there
will be no refund for cancellations after 30 June but please let the
organiser know so pairings can be rearranged.</p>
<p>Byes – entrants may take one half point bye in rounds 1-4. The bye
may not be taken in the last round.</p>
<p>FIDE rated sections will use duplicate score sheets. Both players
must give the top copies to the organisers and sign each of them to
confirm the result. The top copies remain the property of the
congress.</p>
<p>Cars parked at the venue or the accommodation are done so entirely at
the owners own risk.</p>
