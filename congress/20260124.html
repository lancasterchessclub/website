<p><strong>Parental responsibility</strong></p>
<p>Parents are responsible for their children during the congress, the
congress organisers and arbiters are not to act as “in loco parents” and
are not able to take responsibility for any child’s actions. Or for the
actions of anyone that may affect your child. Parents may not speak to
their children during their child’s game, or vice versa, without
approaching the arbiters first.</p>
<p><strong>Other conditions</strong></p>
<p>Eligibility for grade-restricted sections is determined by the
published original December 2025 ECF or FIDE grading list. This means
that which section you enter may be changed by the organisers if your
grade changes between the date of entry and the release of the December
ratings. Players’ ECF or FIDE ratings from the January 2026 original
list will be used for determining tournament pairings, and grading
prizes.</p>
<p>All sections are ECF and FIDE graded. The following priority is used
for section allocation and seeding:</p>
<p>· ECF Rapid Play Grade</p>
<p>· FIDE Rapid Play Rating</p>
<p>· ECF Standard Play Grade</p>
<p>· FIDE Standard Play Grade</p>
<p>· ECF on-line Rapid Play Grade</p>
<p>· FIDE on-line Rapid Play Grade</p>
<p>· ECF on-line Standard Play Grade</p>
<p>· FIDE on-line Standard Play Grade</p>
<p>· Chess.com grade – for pairing and section allocation purposes only
– not eligible for grading prizes</p>
<p>· Lichess grade - for pairing and section allocation purposes only –
not eligible for grading prizes</p>
<p>Players without a current grade should use any grading previously
held from the on-line ECF or FIDE database and provide the link from the
site. This may be accepted as their grading subject to approval by the
Chief Arbiter. Provisional grades may be used subject to decision by the
Chief Arbiter.</p>
<p>Ungraded players are not eligible for a grading prize.</p>
<p>Ungraded players including players with only a chess.com or lichess
grade can only win up to £50 for the major, intermediate or minor
events. Any unallocated prize money in either event will be allocated to
the runner up assuming they are graded.</p>
<p>Results of games between ECF Gold members and FIDE rated players who
are not registered with England and who are not ECF gold members will be
submitted for FIDE rating purposes but not for ECF grading purposes.</p>
<p>A player qualifying for two prizes receives only the higher of the
two prizes.The exception will be three diversity prizes where winners of
these may receive one other prize. In the event of a tie for a diversity
prize the prize money will be divided between the winners. The diversity
prizes will be £50 each. Prize money is subject to change depending on
number of entrants.</p>
<p>In the event of a tie for grading prize, the prize is awarded to the
lowest graded player.</p>
<p>Swiss manager dictates the pairings in all rounds and they are not
changed to suit individual preferences.</p>
<p>Cancellations – in the event that a player is unable to attend there
will be no refund for cancellations after 30 November but please let the
organiser know so pairings can be rearranged. No refunds for non UK
entrants.</p>
<p>Byes – entrants may take one half point bye in round 1. No other byes
are allowed and if taken will result in zero points for that game.</p>
<p>Cars parked anywhere are done so entirely at the owners own risk.</p>
<p><strong>BY ENTERING, PLAYERS AGREE THAT IN THE EVENT OF ANY DISPUTE,
THE ARBITER’S DECISION IS FINAL.</strong></p>
<p><strong>How to find the venue</strong></p>
<p><strong>By road and parking:</strong></p>
<p>Find a parking space and walk to the venue. The cheapest all-day
option is the Station car park which is £4.50. Dearer than the Station
but a bit closer is Dallas Road council parking £9.50 for 9 hours (24
hours - £14). There is also NCP parking on Dallas road which is £7.95
but limited spaces. Apart from these there are car parks in the city
centre but they are usually more expensive and further to walk. The only
free parking is well out of the city centre on side roads.</p>
<p><strong>By rail:</strong></p>
<p>Lancaster Station is on the main west coast rail line from London to
Glasgow and has direct links to Manchester Airport. The Storey is 5
minute walk away.</p>
